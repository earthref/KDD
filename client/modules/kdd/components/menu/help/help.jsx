          The MagIC website continues to evolve. Older tutorials are more likely to not match the current layout exactly, but they 
          should still be quite helpful. Please let us know if they are confusing, especially if it is due to the tutorial not 
          matching the current website.

          <h3>FAQ</h3>
          <b>How do I cite a data set that I have used that is in MagIC?</b><br/>
          <br/>
          Data that you have placed into MagIC as supporting data for a paper should be cited in the paper and placed in the reference
          list. Data downloaded from MagIC should also be cited when used.<br/>
          <br/>
          <i>General data citation form:</i><br/>
          Data Author(s)/Principal Investigator name(s) (YEAR) "Title of Dataset", publisher or distributor, DOI<br/>
          <br/>
          <i>Example Citation</i><br/>

          <b>When should I upload my data for my journal article to MagIC?</b><br/>
          <br/>
          Many journals now require that the data be available to reviewers of your paper while it is in review. Others 
          only require the data to be available at publication. 
          MagIC encourages you to <a href="https://www.earthref.org/MagIC/upload">upload</a> your data to your private workspace
          while you are collecting your data. Setting up your lab to include formatting your data into the MagIC format
          while it is being collected makes the process of uploading it to MagIC much less difficult at publication time.
          We will work with your lab to help you understand our data model, test your formatting of MagIC data files, and 
          create programs that translate data formats, if needed. Many measurement level data converters already exist.<br/>
          <br/>
          If that is not the case and you are looking for a data repository to put your data into after collecting, processing, and
          analysing the data, MagIC is happy to assist you. Having a link to your fully formatted dataset in a private workspace on 
          MagIC will likely improve the chances of your paper being accepted for review and publication.<br/>
          <br/> 
          If you have already have a paper in review and the reviewers are asking which data repository you are planning to use, we
          are happy to work with you at this stage, but formatting your data to the MagIC data model will take some effort and time
          on both your part and ours.
