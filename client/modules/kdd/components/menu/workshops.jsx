         MagIC has hosted workshops in 2011, 2014 and 2017 at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography in La Jolla, California. The format is generally two days of science talks followed by a few days of hands-on tutorials. During the tutorials we give presentations about uploading data into the MagIC database and installing, using, and contributing to the PmagPy paleomagnetic software suite. There is plenty of time given to one-on-one interaction with the MagIC team for help or to give us suggestions. In 2020 the MagIC in-person workshop was postponed due the SARS-CoV-2 virus outbreak and was replaced by a shortened virtual meeting.<br/>
